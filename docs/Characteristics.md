# Characteristics

## AudVid_tab (Characteristics used in the audio and video tabs in application)
### FileInfoCharacteristic (Located in FileInfo_Char.py)
Retreives information from audio and video files, including file size and RMS level for audio recordings. The audio side of the application was left a bit unfinished so this characteristic is mainly only used in the video tab.
